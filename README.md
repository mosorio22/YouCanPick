# YouCanPick

Description:
YouCanPick is a web app built using Flask meant to help indecisive people choose where to eat next. There are 2 features to YouCanPick. On the home page, criteria are used to search for restaurants using Yelp's api. There is also the WeCanPick page that randomly chooses between user input to help users decide between different restaurant options.

Usage:
